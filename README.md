## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get your GitHub PR Dashboard up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest stable version)
- A GitHub account
- A generated GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` and `read:org` permissions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   gh repo clone AKharytonchyk/git-pull-request-dashboard
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd github-pr-dashboard
   ```

3. Configure environment variables (optional):

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` to customize API endpoints and rate limiting if needed. See [Environment Configuration](#environment-configuration) for details.

4. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

## Security and Performance

This application implements enterprise-grade security and performance optimizations. For detailed information, see:

- ðŸ”’ **[Security Guidelines](docs/SECURITY.md)** - Token security, CSP configuration, and best practices
- âš¡ **[Performance Guidelines](docs/PERFORMANCE.md)** - Caching strategies, optimization techniques, and monitoring
- ðŸš€ **[Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Production deployment with dynamic CSP and environment configuration

## Environment Configuration

The application can be customized using environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and modify as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Available Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VITE_GITHUB_API_URL` | `https://api.github.com` | GitHub API endpoint. Use your GitHub Enterprise Server URL if applicable |
| `VITE_GITHUB_AVATAR_URL` | Auto-detected | GitHub avatar URL (optional - auto-detected from API URL) |
| `VITE_GITHUB_BASE_URL` | Auto-detected | GitHub base URL (optional - auto-detected from API URL) |
| `VITE_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` | `200` | Rate limit for API requests (1-5000) |

### Examples

**GitHub.com (default):**
```env
VITE_GITHUB_API_URL=https://api.github.com
VITE_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=200
```

**ACME GitHub Enterprise:**
```env
VITE_GITHUB_API_URL=https://ghe.acme.com/api/v3
VITE_GITHUB_AVATAR_URL=https://avatars.ghe.acme.com
VITE_GITHUB_BASE_URL=https://ghe.acme.com
VITE_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=300
```

**GitHub Enterprise Server:**
```env
VITE_GITHUB_API_URL=https://ghe.your-company.com/api/v3
VITE_GITHUB_AVATAR_URL=https://avatars.ghe.your-company.com
VITE_GITHUB_BASE_URL=https://ghe.your-company.com
VITE_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=300
```

**High-traffic deployment:**
```env
VITE_GITHUB_API_URL=https://api.github.com
VITE_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=500
```

### Features

- **Auto-detection**: Avatar and base URLs are automatically derived from the API URL if not specified
- **Dynamic CSP**: Content Security Policy headers are automatically generated based on your GitHub environment
- **Validation**: All URLs are validated during application startup

## How to Use

### Setting Up Your Personal Access Token

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Navigate to Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Generate new token.
3. Select `repo` and `read:org` scopes.
4. Generate the token and copy it.

**Security Note**: Your token is stored securely in session storage with automatic expiration for enhanced security.

### Connecting Your GitHub Account

- On the GitHub PR Dashboard, enter your PAT and connect your GitHub account.
- The application will validate your token and provide feedback on successful authentication.
- Your authentication session will automatically expire for security purposes.

### Selecting Repositories

- Choose the organizations and repositories you want to monitor through the dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Failures**
- Verify your token has the correct permissions (`repo` and `read:org`)
- Check if your token has expired
- Ensure you're connected to the internet

**No Pull Requests Showing**
- Confirm you've selected repositories in the settings
- Check if the repositories have any open pull requests
- Verify your token has access to the selected repositories

**Rate Limiting**
- The application automatically handles GitHub API rate limits
- If you encounter rate limiting, wait a few minutes and try again
- Consider reducing the number of monitored repositories if the issue persists

**Performance Issues**
- Clear your browser cache and session storage
- Reduce the number of monitored repositories
- Check your internet connection speed
- See [Performance Guidelines](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for optimization tips
